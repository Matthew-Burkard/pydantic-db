    Wrapper for pydantic field with added PyDB args.

    Used to provide extra information about a field, either for the
    model schema or complex validation. Some arguments apply only to
    number fields (``int``, ``float``, ``Decimal``) and some apply only
    to ``str``.

    :param default: Since this is replacing the fieldâ€™s default, its
        first argument is used to set the default, use ellipsis
        (``...``) to indicate the field is required.
    :param indexed: Determines whether this column is indexed.
    :param default_factory: Callable that will be called when a default
        value is needed for this field If both `default` and
        `default_factory` are set, an error is raised.
    :param alias: The public name of the field.
    :param title: Can be any string, used in the schema.
    :param description: Can be any string, used in the schema.
    :param exclude: Exclude this field while dumping.
        Takes same values as the ``include`` and ``exclude`` arguments
        on the ``.dict`` method.
    :param include: Include this field while dumping.
        Takes same values as the ``include`` and ``exclude`` arguments
        on the ``.dict`` method.
    :param const: This field is required and *must* take its default
        value.
    :param gt: Only applies to numbers, requires the field to be
        "greater than". The schema will have an ``exclusiveMinimum``
        validation keyword
    :param ge: Only applies to numbers, requires the field to be
        "greater than or equal to". The schema will have a ``minimum``
        validation keyword.
    :param lt: Only applies to numbers, requires the field to be
        "less than". The schema will have an ``exclusiveMaximum``
        validation keyword.
    :param le: Only applies to numbers, requires the field to be
        "less than or equal to". The schema will have a ``maximum``
        validation keyword.
    :param multiple_of: Only applies to numbers, requires the field to
        be "a multiple of". The schema will have a ``multipleOf``
        validation keyword.
    :param max_digits: Only applies to Decimals, requires the field to
        have a maximum number of digits within the decimal. It does not
        include a zero before the decimal point or trailing decimal
        zeroes.
    :param decimal_places: Only applies to Decimals, requires the field
        to have at most a number of decimal places allowed. It does not
        include trailing decimal zeroes.
    :param min_items: Only applies to lists, requires the field to have
        a minimum number of elements. The schema will have a
        ``minItems`` validation keyword.
    :param max_items: Only applies to lists, requires the field to have
        a maximum number of elements. The schema will have a
        ``maxItems`` validation keyword.
    :param unique_items: Only applies to lists, requires the field not to
        have duplicated elements. The schema will have a ``uniqueItems``
        validation keyword.
    :param min_length: Only applies to strings, requires the field to
        have a minimum length. The schema will have a ``maximum``
        validation keyword.
    :param max_length: Only applies to strings, requires the field to
        have a maximum length. The schema will have a ``maxLength``
        validation keyword.
    :param allow_mutation: A boolean which defaults to True. When False,
        the field raises a TypeError if the field is assigned on an
        instance. The BaseModel Config must set validate_assignment to
        True.
    :param regex: Only applies to strings, requires the field match
        against a regular expression pattern string. The schema will
        have a ``pattern`` validation keyword.
    :param discriminator: Only useful with a (discriminated a.k.a. tagged)
        `Union` of sub models with a common field. The `discriminator`
        is the name of this common field to shorten validation and
        improve generated schema.
    :param repr_: Show this field in the representation.
    :param extra: Any additional keyword arguments will be added as is
        to the schema.
